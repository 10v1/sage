This document has two parts: the Code of Conduct itself, followed by a
part describing the roles and procedures for the Sage Code of Conduct
Committee.

# Code of Conduct #

This Code was approved by the Sage community by a vote which ended on
November 24, 2014.

**The date needs to be updated if these changes are approved.**

## Introduction ##

The Sage community is comprised of an international mixture of mathematicians,
computer scientists, engineers, researchers, teachers, amateurs, and others
with varied backgrounds. This diversity is one of our strengths, but it can
also lead to communication problems and unhappiness. People who love working on
Sage can more effectively collaborate with others if they follow this Code.

## Guidelines ##

1. Be friendly and patient.

2. Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people
   of all backgrounds and identities.

3. Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people and you in turn will
   depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
   developers, so you should take those consequences into account when making
   decisions. Conversely, Sage is constantly evolving, and earlier decisions
   that were made in good faith may sometimes need to be reconsidered.
   Nonetheless, we should still appreciate the hard work done in the past.

4. Be respectful and polite. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
   disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
   experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
   frustration to morph into personal attacks. It is important to remember that
   a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
   productive one. Members of the Sage community should be respectful when
   dealing with other developers and users.

   When we disagree, we should try to understand why. Disagreements, both
   social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
   disagreements and differing views constructively. Being unable to understand
   why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Do not
   forget that it is human to err. Blame alone gets us nowhere, it is better to
   help resolve issues so we can all learn from our mistakes.

5. We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behavior, such as:

    1. Violent or intimidating threats or language directed against another person.
    2. Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    3. Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    4. Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    5. Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    6. Unwelcome sexual attention or comments.
    7. Excessive profanity. Please avoid swear words; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
    8. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    9. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Sage
project, including all public and private mailing lists, issue
trackers, wikis, and any other communication channel used by our
community. It also applies to Sage Days and any other in-person or
virtual events.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the Sage community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation
with the project, in any project-related activities, and, especially,
when representing the project, in any role.

This code is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our
common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and
goals. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter,
to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the
surrounding community.

## Diversity statement ##

Sage welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people
of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to promoting and
sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and
learning, and we work together as a community to help each other live
out these values.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we
welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we
explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype,
gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype,
phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual
orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture, and technical ability,
to the extent that these do not conflict with this Code of Conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Sage development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behavior in the Sage community are detailed in the Code
of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these
standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well.

## Reporting guidelines ##

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to
start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize
that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the
guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when
deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Sage Code of
Conduct Committee (see below). For possibly unintentional breaches,
you may reply to the person and point out this Code of Conduct (either
in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate). If you would
prefer not to do that, please feel free to report to the Sage Code of
Conduct Committee directly, or ask the committee for advice, in
confidence.

You can report issues to the Sage Code of Conduct Committee at
sage-conduct@googlegroups.com. Currently, the committee consists of:

- Vincent Delecroix
- David Joyner
- John Palmieri
- David Roe
- William Stein

If your report involves any members of the committee, or if they feel
they have a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse
themselves from considering your report. Alternatively, if, for any
reason, you feel uncomfortable making a report to the whole committee,
then you can also contact individual committee members.

## Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement ##

This section summarizes the most important points; more details can be
found in the Code of Conduct enforcement guide.

The Sage Code of Conduct Committee will investigate and respond to all
complaints. The committee will protect the identity of the reporter,
and treat the content of complaints as confidential (unless the
reporter agrees otherwise).

In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g., personal threat or
violent, sexist or racist language, the committee will immediately
disconnect the originator from Sage communication channels; please see
the manual for details.

In cases not involving clear severe and obvious breaches of this Code
of Conduct, the process for acting on any received Code of Conduct
violation report will be:

- acknowledgement that the report has been received
- discussion within the committee
- discussion with and/or feedback provided to the reportee
- mediation (if feedback didn’t help, and only if both reporter and
  reportee agree to this)
- enforcement via transparent decision by the Sage Code of Conduct Committee

The committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and our
goal will be to respond within 72 hours.

Potential consequences for violating the Sage Code of Conduct include:

- Nothing (for example if the matter has been resolved publicly while
  the committee was considering responses)
- Private feedback or reprimand to the individual(s) involved
- Warning the person to cease their behavior and that any further
  reports will result in sanctions
- A public announcement that an incident occurred
- Mediation (only if both reporter and reportee agree)
- An imposed vacation (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list)
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Sage spaces (mailing
  lists, GitHub repos, in-person events, etc.)
- Assistance to the reporter with a report to other bodies, for
  example, institutional offices or appropriate law enforcement
  agencies
- Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the
  resignation of the alleged harasser from their responsibilities
  (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called
  for if the person is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside
  from the conflict of interest, or similar)
- Any other response that the Sage Code of Conduct Committee deems necessary and
  appropriate to the situation

# Guide for the Sage Code of Conduct Committee #

## Introduction ##

This is the manual followed by the Sage Code of Conduct Committee. It is used
when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair.

Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the
future. It’s an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing
enforcement measures, the Sage Code of Conduct Committee will keep the
following values and guidelines in mind:

- Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal. The committee can
  engage the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the
  privacy and any necessary confidentiality of reporters. However,
  it is sometimes necessary to communicate with one or more
  individuals directly: the committee’s goal is to improve the health
  of our community rather than only produce a formal decision.

- Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior,
  avoiding binary labels of “good” and “bad/evil”. Overt, clear-cut
  aggression and harassment exists and we will address that
  firmly. But many scenarios that can prove challenging to resolve are
  those where normal disagreements devolve into unhelpful or harmful
  behavior from multiple parties. Understanding the full context and
  finding a path that re-engages all is hard, but ultimately the most
  productive for our community.

- We understand that email is a difficult medium and can be
  isolating. Receiving criticism over email, without personal contact,
  can be particularly painful. This makes it especially important to
  keep an atmosphere of open-minded respect of the views of others. It
  also means that we must be transparent in our actions, and that we
  will do everything in our power to make sure that all our members
  are treated fairly and with sympathy.

- Discrimination can be subtle and it can be unconscious. It can show
  itself as unfairness and hostility in otherwise ordinary
  interactions. We know that this does occur, and we will take care to
  look out for it. We would very much like to hear from you if you
  feel you have been treated unfairly, and we will use these
  procedures to make sure that your complaint is heard and addressed.

- Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to
  identify where discussion may have broken down and provide
  actionable information, pointers and resources that can lead to
  positive change on these points.

- Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit
  support and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation
  from underrepresented groups in particular.

Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native
languages. Try to identify any honest misunderstandings caused by a
non-native speaker and help them understand the issue and what they
can change to avoid causing offense. Complex discussion in a foreign
language can be very intimidating, and we want to grow our diversity
also across nationalities and cultures.

Mediation: voluntary, informal mediation is a tool at our disposal. In
some contexts, such as when two or more parties have escalated to the
point of inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human
conflict), it may be useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is
only an example: the committee can consider mediation in any case,
mindful that the process is meant to be strictly voluntary and no
party can be pressured to participate. If the committee suggests
mediation, it should:

- Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.

- Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have
  complete freedom to decline the mediation idea, or to propose an
  alternate mediator.

- Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).

- Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different
  mediator than the suggested candidate, only if common agreement is
  reached on all terms can the process move forward.

- Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two weeks.

The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution
that is satisfactory to all. Upon completion, the mediator will
provide a report (vetted by all parties to the process) to the
committee, with recommendations on further steps. The committee will
then evaluate these results (whether satisfactory resolution was
achieved or not) and decide on any additional action deemed necessary.

## How the committee will respond to reports ##

When the committee (or a committee member) receives a report, they
will first determine whether the report is about a clear and severe
breach (as defined below). If so, immediate action needs to be taken
in addition to the regular report-handling process.

### Clear and severe breach actions ###

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to
start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal
quickly with clear and severe breaches like personal threats, violent,
sexist, or racist language.

When a member of the Sage Code of Conduct Committee becomes aware of a
clear and severe breach, they will do the following:

- Immediately disconnect the originator from all Sage communication channels.

- Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that
  the originator has been disconnected.

- In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to
  contact the originator, and tell them specifically how their
  language or actions qualify as a “clear and severe breach”. The
  moderator should also say that, if the originator believes this is
  unfair or they want to be reconnected to Sage, they have the right
  to ask for a review, as below, by the Sage Code of Conduct Committee. The
  moderator should copy this explanation to the Sage Code of Conduct
  Committee.

The Sage Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on all
cases where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is not
being used to control ordinary heated disagreement.

### Report handling ###

When a report is sent to the committee, they will immediately reply to
the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72
hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

If a report doesn’t contain enough information, the committee will
obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to
contact any individuals involved to get a more complete account of
events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- What happened.

- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.

- Who are the responsible party/parties.

- Whether this is an ongoing situation, and whether there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible
the group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e., chat
transcripts, email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries
of voice conversations, etc.).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this
committee to ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional
memory for the project. To assist in this, the default channel of
discussion for this committee will be a private mailing list
accessible to current and future members of the committee. If the
committee finds the need to use off-list communications (e.g., phone
calls for early/rapid response), it should, in all cases, summarize
these back to the list so there’s a good record of the process.

The Sage Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon
within two weeks. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined
in that time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an
update and projected timeline for the resolution.

## Resolutions ##

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the committee is
empowered to consult as needed to try to reach consensus.

Possible responses may include:

- Taking no further action:

  - if we determine no violations have occurred.

  - if the matter has been resolved publicly while the committee was considering responses.

- Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the
  committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.

- Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language
  have been judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or
  can but hurtful to some people, requesting the community to
  self-adjust.

- A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s)
  involved. In this case, a representative of the committee will
  deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the
  group.

- A public reprimand. In this case, a committee representative will deliver
  that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within
  the limits of practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an
  email violation, but for a chat room discussion where the
  person/context may be gone, they can be reached by other means. The
  group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for documentation
  purposes.

- A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter
  agrees to this idea: they may, at their discretion, refuse further
  contact with the violator. A committee representative will deliver
  this request. The committee may, if it chooses, attach “strings” to
  this request: for example, the group may ask a violator to
  apologize, in order to retain one’s membership on a mailing list.

- A “mutually agreed upon hiatus” where the committee asks the
  individual to temporarily refrain from community participation. If
  the individual chooses not to take a temporary break voluntarily,
  the committee may issue a “mandatory cooling off period”.

- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Sage spaces (mailing
  lists, GitHub, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such
  bans so that they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise
  maintained.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, the committee will contact the
original reporter and any other affected parties and explain that the
committee has taken action. Depending on the situation, the committee
may or may not choose to provide further details about what actions
were taken and how they might affect the reporter.

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public
statements will be made by a representative of the Sage Code of Conduct
Committee.

## Conflicts of interest ##

In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must
immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if
necessary.
